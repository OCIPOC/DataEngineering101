# CAP theorem

CAP theorem states a database cannot guarantee consistency, availability and partition-tolerance at the same time.

But you can't srcrifice partition-tolerance, so you must make a tradeoff between availability and consistency.

Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL movement.
